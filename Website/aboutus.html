    rights for the Premier League and almost all the domestic rights of Hollywood films.

    its holding company British Sky Broadcasting Group plc changed its name to Sky plc 
    (now Sky Group Limited).[5] The UK subsidiary's name was changed from British Sky Broadcasting 
    Limited to Sky UK Limited, and continuing to trade as "Sky".
