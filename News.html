Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian former PM who overcame various scandals to hold office four times, has died at 86.
He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. In April, he was treated for a lung infection linked to leukaemia.
Berlusconi's death leaves a "huge void", Italy's defence minister said, with a national day of mourning due to take place on Wednesday.
The longest-serving prime minister in post-war Italy, he had bounced back from sex scandals and corruption cases.
After taking political office in 1994, the billionaire media tycoon led four governments until 2011 - though not consecutively.
Last September, Berlusconi's centre-right Forza Italia party went into coalition under right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
